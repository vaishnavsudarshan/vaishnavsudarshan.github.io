    "text": "Introduction\nHave you ever wondered how kids sing their “abc’s” in different places? In some places, kids sing their “alpha beta gamma’s” or their “alif baa jiim’s”, which are pretty similar to our own. In some places, kids recite their “ka kha ga gha nga’s”, quite different from our own. Yet in other places, such a song about their “alphabet” would be physically impossible, with kids thinking this is a preposterous and cruel joke. All of these are tricks for remembering letters, which are part of writing systems. Writing systems are also known as orthographies. You already know at least one - the Latin alphabet, which you’re reading right now. Here’s an overview of how all the different writing systems work."

    "title": "Writing Systems",
    "section": "Phonetic Orthographies",
    "text": "Phonetic Orthographies\nIn phonetic writing systems, symbols are written based on sound. For example, in the Latin alphabet, the word “cat” is written with a “c” for the “c” sound, “a” for the “a” sound, and “t” for the “t” sound. Of course, it’s not always one-to-one, or even consistent, in English itself (cough cough, “cough”), but the main point still stands - it’s based on sound. In our language, you wouldn’t draw an image of a cat to represent a cat, you’d just write “cat” based on the sounds of the word. Here are the types of phonetic writing systems:\n\nAlphabets\nAlphabets work by having symbols for vowels and consonants, and they’re just written without really being treated as separate phonemes. These are arguably the simplest. Apart from the Latin alphabet, some others are Cyrillic, Greek, IPA, Georgian, Armenian, etc. Korean’s writing system, Hangeul, is kind of like an alphabet because it writes out its vowels and consonants, but it arranges each syllable into its own block. For example, the characters for “ba” would be 바, but the characters for “bo” would be 보. Furthermore, the characters for “bol” would be 볼. The word alphabet comes from the first to letters of Greek, alpha and beta.\n\n\nAbjads\nMost alphabets evolved from abjads. Abjads are like alphabets, except usually, most of the vowels aren’t written, and instead inferred from context. Only long vowels are written. Sometimes, for clarity, the short vowels may be written in with diacritics. For example, in the Quran, even though the Arabic script is an abjad, all the vowels were written so that there aren’t any misinterpretations. The word “abjad” comes from the first sounds of the four letters of the Arabic script, “a”, “b”, “j”, and “d”, which is cognate with Greek’s “alpha”, “beta”, “gamma”, “delta”.\nThe most prominent example of abjads are the orthographies of Semitic languages, which it works well for due to their triconsonantal root system, where consonants carry the meaning and vowels just modify the word. Hwvr, f y d ths n nglsh, t wll b prtt mssd p nd nt t ll ntllgbl.\n\n\nSyllabaries\nIn syllabaries, each symbol is a syllable, usually a pair of consonant and vowel. These work well for languages that don’t have crazy consonant clusters, like Japanese and Cherokee. However, if a language has a lot of possible syllables due to its large phonology, then there would be way too many symbols. \n\n\nAbugidas\nAbugidas, in my opinion, are by far the coolest type of phonetic orthography. How it works is that if you write a consonant on its own, it comes with a vowel after it. For example, the /k/ sound in Devanagari, क, is actually pronounced /kə/ because without altering the consonant, it comes with an /ə/ sound. To make it a different vowel, you add a diacritic. So, /ke/ would be के. And, to make it just /k/ with no vowel, you make it क्. The most popular abugidas are from India, including Devanagiri, Tamil, Bengali, etc. However, the word “abugida” comes from the Ge’ez script from Ethiopia, where the first four letters are “a”, “bu”, “gi”, and “da” (and this arrangement is cognate with Greek’s “alpha”, “beta”, “gamma”, “delta”, just like with the word “Abjad”). Another notable abugida, apart from Indian scripts, Southeast Asian scripts, and the Ge’ez script, is the Cree script. For changing the vowel, Cree doesn’t actually add a diacritic, but instead modifies the consonant through rotations. Cree is actually partially inspired by Devanagiri."

    "title": "Writing Systems",
    "section": "Semantic Orthographies",
    "text": "Semantic Orthographies\nInstead of writing symbols based on sound, some languages have orthographies where symbols are based on meaning.\n\nLogographies\nThe most common type of semantic writing system is a logography, and the most famous type of logography is Hanzi from Sinitic languages, which is also what Japanese’s Kanji is based on. For example, look at the symbol for “yi” in Mandarin or “ichi” in Japanese, which means “one”: “一” Now, for “er” in Mandarin or “ni” in Japanese, which means “two”: “二” So, sometimes, the symbol looks like what it means. However, sometimes, it can be more complicated than that. In Mandarin, each symbol is generally one syllable as well, and sometimes symbols are made based on their relation with other semantic meanings, so you can build up symbols from smaller symbols. For example, the symbol for “forest” is: 森 while the symbol for “tree” is: 木 Also, symbols whose words sound similar can also be used for clarification. Egyptian hieroglyphs were part logography. Some symbols worked just like Chinese, and others evolved into more of a syllabary or abjad.\n\n\nPictographies\nPictographies are kind of like logographies, except that it’s much more literal. Unlike Hanzi, where a lot of characters are derived from abstract connections, pictographies are literal depictions. This is likely where writing started first. An example is the Mayan script, where a lot of it was pictographic, but other symbols evolved into being logographic or syllabic. Also, even emojis are largely pictographic. However, pictographs, like logographs, still just represent words. \n\n\nIdeographies\nIdeographies are another type of semantic orthography, where an idea or a concept is directly written, without being tied to a specific sound. For example, some street signs symbols that don’t have words but rather symbols, some of the more ancient Hanzi initially, or even some of the more abstract emojis as well are ideographies."

    "section": "Evolution of writing",
    "text": "Evolution of writing\nMany writing systems evolved from Egyptian hieroglyphs, to become primarily alphabets, abjads, or even abugidas. This is primarily in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, where Egypt indirectly influenced. For example, the European alphabets evolved from Ancient Greek’s alphabet (Latin through the Etruscan alphabet, which in turn came from the Ancient Greek alphabet), which evolved from Phoenecian’s abjad, which evolved from Egyptian hieroglyphs. Also, the Semitic abjads evolved from Phoenician’s abjad too. The Semitic languages are written from right to left, because it chose a direction to write from Phoenecian, which alternated. Ancient Greek also initially alternated directions line by line, but then chose to stick with only left to right, which all the European languages are written with now.\nIn India, as well as some parts of Southeast Asia, including Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand, the orthography (all abugidas) of those languages evolved from the Brahmi script, which was an abugida. It’s not certain where the Brahmi script is from, though it’s suggested to come from Egyptian hieroglyphs too, but it could also be an artificially created script that evolved naturally.\n\n\n\nAn example of Brahmi script found on The Iron Pillar in Qutub Minar, New Delhi, source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCool fact to bore your friends with and be called a nerd!!!\n\n\n\nThe Brahmi script was initially all straight lines and sharp angles. In South India, Southeast Asia, and Sri Lanka, the letters look more curvy, because they were written on leaves, so sharp turns and straight lines would tear the leaves. However, in North India, the letters can be more angular and sharp, but still also some curves, because they were written on both leaves and stone.\n\n\nIn China and Japan, the characters are derived from the Ancient Chinese logographic characters. In Japan, there are three writing systems. Two are syllabaries derived from Chinese, and the other is the normal Chinese logography.\nIn both Koreas, Hangeul is used. Hangeul is an artificially created script that was made to address the high percentage of illiteracy, due to the fact that Chinese characters were way to hard for the common people to learn. However, Hangeul was designed to be very simple.\nThe Cherokee syllabary was made after one Native American looked at the European colonizers’ writing and tried to mimic the symbols to make a writing system for Cherokee. He’d seen both the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. However, the symbols in Cherokee that look similar to the European writing make completely different sounds, as he only knew the shape of the symbols, not what sound they made."

    "section": "Consonants",
    "text": "Consonants\n\nPlace of Articulation\nPlace of articulation is essentially where in your mouth a sound is being made, whether it be deep in the throat (I’m looking at you, certain language primarily spoken in a country that borders Belgium, Germany, Luxembourg, Spain, Andorra, Monaco, Brazil, Suriname, and Italy) or front in the lips (like at the end of “dumb”). From deepest in the throat to closest in the lips, the most commonly referred to categories include glottal, pharyngeal, uvular, velar, retroflex, palatal, alveolar, dental, labiodental, and bilabial.\n\n\nManner of Articulation\nManner of articulation is how the sound is actually made. For example, there is a difference between “boron” and “moron”, even though both /b/ and /m/ are both “bilabial” sounds (one of the places of articulation mentioned above). Such manners of articulation include:\nFricatives (blowing air, like in the “sssss” sound in “snake”);\nPlosives (stopping the sound, like how in “dart”, pronouncing both the /d/ and /t/ can’t really be continued);\nNasals (where air comes out of your “nnnnn-nostrils”);\nTrills (where a sound is like a plosive but gets rolled, like the Spanish rolled r in “perro”);\nClicks (air is sucked in instead of pushed out, but unfortunately these cool sounds don’t exist in English, so I can’t provide an example you know how to pronounce. However, the name of the language Xhosa, (in)famous for having a lot of clicks, has a click in its name when not butchered as /kshosa/);\nand more.\n\n\nMore\nAnother important parameter is voicedness. Voicedness is just if the vocal cords are vibrating while the sound is being made. To understand this, look at /s/ and /z/, or /k/ and /g/ (as an exercise, find the voiceless version of /b/). In most languages, this has a really important distinction. For example, take “tie” and “die”. However, we usually just include this within manner of articulation, because we can’t put 3D charts on the iPad screen your face is glued to.\nConsonants are classified in other ways than just the two (or three) parameters, though. For example, there are pulmonic and non-pulmonic consonants. This just means if the sound is normal or a freak that doesn’t use air coming from the lungs. The only non-pulmonic consonants are implosives, ejectives, and clicks, and the rest are generally pulmonic. There is also sonorance or obstruence. Sonorance means the vocal tract is pretty open, like a vowel. As a result, most sonorants, which include nasals, approximants, and liquids, tend to be voiced. Obstruence means there is some friction or turbulence which make the sounds more easily voiceless and are noisier.\nAdditionally, there are more factors that can alter a consonant.\nIf you know Hindi, for example, you know how aspiration - putting extra air after a consonant - can impact a word and does matter, like in the words “पल” (pronounced like “pal”, meaning “moment”) and “फल” (pronounced like “phal”, meaning “fruit”).\nIn Russian, palatalization - making the consonant more like a palatal sound, which basically just makes it sound like “y” sound is at the end - is a very important factor too, with the words “мать” (pronounced like “maty” with the y being as in “yo” and not “corny”) meaning “mother” but “мат” (pronounced like “mat”) meaning a swear word.\nGemination - making a consonant pronounced for longer - is important in Finnish, because “tapa” means “way” or “manner”, but “tappa” means “kill”."

    "section": "Vowels",
    "text": "Vowels\nEven in vowels, two main parameters affect how a vowel is made. While vowels are not that interesting in my opinion, they are definitely required, because without them you’d be speaking either gibberish or Polish. Vowels tend to be voiced because they are sonorant and made by vibrating the vocal cords.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nCool fact to bore your friends with and be called a nerd!!!\n\n\n\nThe reason why whispering is quiet is because what you’re really doing is not vibrating your vocal cords at all. Since vowels are inherently voiced, by whispering, you end up not being able to project your voice very much at all, as vowels are kind of the base of speech.\n\n\nThe parameters are frontness (deep in the throat or front in the mouth) and closedness (is mouth open or closed). A third binary parameter is there, roundedness, which is if your mouth is shaped like a circle or not. For example, the /i/ sound is a closed front unrounded vowel.\nThere are many more variations to vowels that can be made now. For example, tone is a big factor in Mandarin. 糖 (táng) means sugar, but 汤 (tāng) means soup. Nasality (how much air comes out of the nostrils) is important in Fr*nch, as “a” means “has” but “an” means “year”. Rhoticity (how much the vowel sounds r-colored) makes the word “or” sound American when rhotic, but British when you only pronounce it like /oː/. Vowels can also have creaky or breathy voice (basically making it sound like a sheep or a zombie).\n\nVowel Harmony\nVowel harmony is a very cool property found in some languages.\nBasically, all vowels in a word must be made with the same frontness, and sometimes closedness or roundedness too.\n\nExample\nFor example, in Kazakh, the plural marker is either “-лаp” or “-лер” (/lar/ or /ler/) depending on if the root of the noun is front or back.\n“қала” (/qɑˈlɑ/), meaning “city”, uses back vowels, so “cities” is “қалалар”.\nHowever, “көл” (/kœl/) meaning “lake”, uses front vowels, so “lakes” is “көлдер”.\nKazakh also has roundedness vowel harmony."

    "section": "Pronunciation and Alphabet",
    "text": "Pronunciation and Alphabet\nLimit is written in Roman characters (for now, that is; we will introduce the real writing system later), but there are some rules to how the script works.\nConsonants are mostly lowercase, with the only exception being the letter “L”, which is always capitalized. Each consonant is a short sound. Short vowel sounds are lowercase, while long vowel sounds are uppercase. The language is very phonetic; the pronunciation is exactly what is written. There are no silent letters.\nExamples for how to write and pronounce vowels:\n1. A short “O” like in the word “dog” would be lowercase.\n2. A long “A” like in the word “cake” would be uppercase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA quick note: The letter “U” (capital, which means long) does not contain a “y” sound in its pronunciation. It sounds like the o’s in the word “food” rather than the u in the word “university”.\nThere are some vowel and consonant sounds, of course, that cannot be produced with just the Roman alphabet. Therefore, the Limit alphabet contains some extra characters as well.\n\n\n\nExtra vowel sounds\n\n“%” sounds like “oo” in the word “book”.\n\n“@” sounds like “ow” like in the word “now”.\n\n“α” sounds like “ah” like in the word “drama”\n\n“&” sounds like “oi” like in the word “boy”.\n\n“*” sounds like “er” like in the word “singer”.\n\n“^” sounds like “on” like in the word “bon” in French (used for foreign loanwords).\n\n\n\nExtra consonant sounds\n\n“#” sounds like “zh”, like in the s in “measure”.\n\n“~” sounds like “th”, like in the word “think”.\n\n“β” sounds like the n in “song”.\n\n“!” sounds like “sh”, like in the word “shook”.\n\n\n\nOther adjustments to the alphabet\n\nTo make the “ar” or “or” sound, take “α” or “O” and add “*”.\n\nThe letter “c” is removed as its sound can be made from either “k” or “s”.\n\nThe letter “g” only can sound like the g in “gray”, and NOT sound like a j, like in “giraffe”.\n\nThe letter “j” is removed as any sound with a “j” can be made from “d#”.\n\nThe letter “q” is removed as any “qu” sound can be made with “kw” instead. “u”, however, is still perfectly safe as it is important for various vowel sounds.\n\nThe letter “x” is removed as any sound with an “x” can be made from either “ks” or “z”.\n\nSlashes indicate that some specific words are grouped together.\n\nOne last thing: Limit is pronounced in either an Indian or an American accent, except with the new pronunciation rules now given."

For example, 243 would be 2*102+4*101+3*10^0.\nYou may know that “time ten to the power of” can also be written as “E”. In Limit, the symbol for this is “$”, pronounced “sigmα”. Fun fact: this word also means “and”.\nYou would write the each place value from highest exponent to lowest.\nInstead of saying plus, you would just combine each term with a slash.\nUnits digits do not need to be written as a$0, just a.\nBack to the example of 243, in Limit you would say this as:\n2$2/4\\(1/3, and pronounce this as rO\\)rO/yA$hα/jU, and remember that $ is pronounced as sigmα.\nFor negative numbers, add the suffix “yO”.\nFor ordinal numbers, add the suffix “hO”, after the “yO” if it is there.\nFor fractions, just use the postposition for “in”, which is the suffix “krA” or “OkrA”. There will be a space after that.\nYou can also just list each digit, but then you must indicate the decimal point when applicable, which is pronounced as “%nd” and is written as “*”.\nExample:\nYou would say “31.4th” as “jU\\(hα/hα/yA\\)hαyOhO”."

    "section": "",
    "text": "Yap\n I went ice skating today. I only go around once a year, which means I basically forget any progress I make in not looking like a monkey when I try each time. Just as I started to remotely get the hang of it for the third time in my life, I went to take a look at all the sponsors of the rink putting ads around it. One that caught my eye was, of course, from AoPS, which is what is shown on the image:\n“Does this problem make your brain FREEZE? Combine plus signs and eight 8’s to get 1,000.”\nWhile the problem was really simple just by brute forcing and intuition that even a six or seven year old (hehe) could solve it. The ad was, after all, placed to a general audience, not a bunch of orz IMO quals.\nHowever, out of my annoyingness, I sought to prove rigorously that the answer I got was the only possible one. I did this in my head, closing any logic holes, while at the same time figuring out how to ice skate properly (at least I was getting better at moving continuously, but my center of mass was still all over the place, so I ended up looking like a monkey anyway, but at least I never fell in the entirety of the hour I was there). So, without further ado, here’s the solution:\n\n\nActual Solution\nAssume there are \\(n\\) numbers being added up. \\(1 \\leq n \\leq 8\\), since there are at most eight numbers, which means there is one per digit, and at least one number, which is when all the digits are in one number.\nNow, we consider the sum mod \\(10\\). Since all \\(n\\) numbers have a units digit of \\(8\\) as it’s the only possible digit, and they add up to \\(1000\\), we get \\(8n \\equiv 0 \\pmod{10}\\). What this means is that \\(8n\\) is a multiple of \\(10\\), so it must also be a multiple of \\(5\\), since \\(10\\) is a multiple of \\(5\\). Since \\(8\\) is not a multiple of \\(5\\), but \\(8n\\) is a multiple of \\(5\\), then \\(n\\) must be a multiple of \\(5\\). The only multiple of \\(5\\) between \\(1\\) and \\(8\\) is \\(n = 5\\). Therefore, we have five numbers being added up.\nWe know that the maximum possible number is \\(888\\), because \\(8888\\) is already greater than \\(1000\\). If there are \\(2\\) or more \\(888\\)’s being added up, then the sum is also over \\(1000\\).\nWe wish to prove that there are not zero \\(888\\)’s either. Assume by contradiction that there actually are zero \\(888\\)’s, so the maximum possible number is just \\(88\\). Now, the maximum possible sum is just \\(4 \\cdot 88\\) which is far less than \\(1000\\) (this is the maximum because every \\(88\\) is the equivalent of adding eleven \\(8\\)’s). Also, to verify that in my head, instead of calculating, I just saw that \\(4 \\cdot 88 &lt; 4 \\cdot 100 = 400 &lt; 1000\\). Therefore, there must be exactly one \\(888\\) being added up.\nWe find the remaining four numbers must add up to \\(112\\). We can do a similar process to find the number of \\(88\\)’s that must be present. If there are no \\(88\\)’s, then the maximum sum is \\(32\\), not even close to \\(112\\). However, if there are two or more \\(88\\)’s, then the sum is already over \\(112\\). Therefore, there must be exactly one \\(88\\) present.\nSince there is exactly one \\(888\\) and exactly one \\(88\\), and there aren’t any higher possible numbers, the remaining three \\(8\\)’s are used with one \\(8\\) per number, filling up the remaining three numbers needed.\nTherefore, the final sum is \\(\\fbox{888 + 88 + 8 + 8 + 8 = 1000}\\). There are also \\(40\\) different ways to rearrange that same equation and keep it true, because it’s \\(2 \\cdot \\frac{5!}{3!}\\) (the \\(5!\\) is to rearrange all the five numbers being added, the \\(3!\\) is because we don’t care the order the individual \\(8\\)’s are in because it’s all the same, and the \\(2\\) is to make the sum on the left hand side or the right hand side)."

    "section": "Confusing Introduction",
    "text": "Confusing Introduction\nPreviously, in orthographies, and phonetics and phonology, we’ve discussed sounds and their symbols. Now, we take a step further into meaning.\nNow, I want to emphasize that GENERALLY, sound and meaning are two separate things. This should make sense if you think about it - the meaning of “meaning” is just the idea tied to that word, and the sound is how that word is pronounced. There is nothing about the voiced bilabial nasal /m/ or the closed front unrounded vowel /i/ that makes the word “meaning” tied to the idea of “the idea tied to that word”. Note to reader: I do not apologize for provding confusing examples like this.\nIt may appear that there are exceptions. For example, the “wh” in English commonly indicates an interrogative word, like the five that are commonly referenced - “who”, “what”, “why”, “where”, “when”. However, there’s nothing about the labiovelar approximant that is inherently tied to interrogative words. Instead, that was just an arbitrary sound that happened to evolve this way. Instead of calling the “w” and the “h” as phonemes, we would call “wh” a unit that evolved out of a morpheme.\nA morpheme is loosely defined as a unit of meaning. You may wonder why we do not just use the term “words” to describe these. The answer is that “words” are quite hard to define - I mean, an app like Word or Google Docs might just measure the number of spaces and then add one, because that’s generally convenient in English, but what about something like Mandarin? Would every sentence in Mandarin be a single “word” because there aren’t any spaces? Such a question isn’t easy or even helpful. Therefore, we use morphemes instead.\nSince sound and meaning are independent, if your English teacher ever uses something like alliteration or rhyme to analyze a literary text, now you know that such an analysis is completely bogus. However, another possiblity also exists - your teacher is imagining how that sound is pronounced, and the manner and difficulty could add some “insightful” meaning (by which I mean that it’s definitely not intended to be that deep, and any such annotation is surely a stretch)."

    "title": "Morphology and Semantics",
    "section": "Types of Morphology Across Languages",
    "text": "Types of Morphology Across Languages\nThere are two continuums that determine how a language’s morphology works. The first measures how many morphemes are squished into a single word, and the second measures how clearly morphemes are separated.\n\nSpectrum 1\nThe first continuum ranges from one morpheme per word to multiple morphemes put together in a word to entire sentences fit in a word. In that order, the types of languages would be analytic, synthetic, and polysynthetic.\nAnalytic languages would be something like Mandarin - the sentence “I don’t drink tea” would be “我不喝茶” (“Wǒ bù hē chá”). Each word is its own morpheme here. Purely analytic languages don’t rely on inflection, or altering the form of words - instead, they rely on particles, which are words that are put next to other words to c hange the grammatical meaning.\nAs a sidenote, Google Translate clearly agrees that each character is a word in this case, as shown here.\n\n\n\nShows how Google Translate separates words in Pinyin\n\n\nSynthetic languages actually inflect more and rely less on particles. For example, Latin uses verb conjugations and noun declensions to reflect gender, number, case, person, and more. As a result, it doesn’t use articles, pronouns are optional, and there are less words in general. However, the entire sentence doesn’t get smushed together, and you can still tell apart subjects, verbs, and objects.\nPolysynthetic languages are like an extreme form of regular synthetic languages. A single word could contain the meaning of an entire sentence, combining morphemes of subjects, objects, and verbs. You may have seen super long words of some indigenous languages of the Eskimo-Aleut family in Greenland, Alaska, and Northern Canada (possibly on signs while playing GeoGuessr), and wondered what they were yapping. Now you know it’s not actual yap, just a normal sentence put together into a giant word.\nBut hold on, I thought words aren’t reliable measurements, so why do we use words here? Here, linguists use the practical working definition of a word, which is essentially something that makes sense being separated and independent. For example, morphemes like affixes would just be considered part of that word, but adjectives would be their own word (at least, that’s how English treats affixes and adjectives). So, it’s not purely based on how they’re written down, but there doesn’t necessarily need to be a clean line either. It’s just on average, how is the density of morphemes generally?\n\n\nSpectrum 2\nThe second continuum ranges from very clear distinction between morphemes to completely unique, unpredictable morphemes outlining certain features- agglutinative to fusional.\nAn agglutinative language like Turkish clearly separates all of its morphemes. Take the “word” (more like sentence) “Evlerimizdenmişsiniz”.\nBreakdown:\nEv → “house” (root noun)\n-ler → plural → Evler = “houses”\n-imiz → our → Evlerimiz = “our houses”\n-den → from → Evlerimizden = “from our houses”\n-miş → hearsay/past tense → Evlerimizdenmiş = “it seems it was from our houses”\n-siniz → second person plural → Evlerimizdenmişsiniz = “apparently you (all) were from our houses”\nHowever, look at fusional languages. In Spanish, “hablamos” means “we speak”, with the ending “-amos” indicating that the pronoun is first person, and also plural (“we”). If you just knew the first person ending that’s not plural (“-o”), then you still wouldn’t be able to derive the ending “-amos” from that.\n\n\nConsonantal Root Systems\nThere is a feature in languages where the root meaning is carried out through the consonants, and the vowels between them just modify the meaning. This is pretty much unseen outside of Afro-Asiatic langauges.\nMost famously, Semitic languages (a sub-branch of Afro-Asiatic) such as Arabic and Hebrew use the triconsonantal root system. In Arabic, for example, the root “k-t-b” has to do with writing and books. The word “kitab” means “book”, the word “katib” means “writer”, and the word “maktaba” means “library”.\nNote that the extra consonant “m” in “maktaba” is added, because Arabic itself isn’t purely consonantal, and uses affixes as well. Interestingly, the word “kitab” spread to many languages like Farsi or Hindi to mean “book”, but since those languages aren’t Semitic, they don’t think of “kitab” using the triconsonantal root system, but rather just as any other word.\nGermanic languages like English do just just a little. Primarily, this is shown in tense changes, like “sing” -&gt; “sung” -&gt; “sang”, or “run” -&gt; “run” -&gt; “ran” as opposed to something like “reprimand” -&gt; “reprimanded” -&gt; “reprimanded”, where the latter is regular."

    "text": "Semantics Intro\nSemantics is how we know how close words’ meanings are. Just from writing, it’s not always possible. For example, take the words “cat”, “dog”, and “catastrophe”. If you didn’t know English, you might guess that perhaps “cat” and “catastrophe” are close in meaning, but that’s not true, relative to “dog” (dog-lovers, I know you’ll strongly object and point out that cats are a form of catastrophes). In fact, “dog” and “cat” are actually more closely related to each other than to “catastrophe”, because they both are pets.\nIn a future blog post, I’ll talk exclusively about semantics, but for right now, I’ll talk about a specific aspect of it.\n\nApplications In AI\nNatural Language Processing (NLP) not only allows computers to get a sense of how meanings are related, but also provides us humans a nice way to visualize them.\nI will talk about meanings in the context of NLP more in my AI blogs, but for right now, I’ll provide a brief explanation. Basically, the AI user’s input is split into tokens, which are kind of like morphemes except that they don’t necessarily provide any grammatical meaning, instead just smaller meanings that are convenient for the AI to handle.\nEvery token in the language (in our case, English) is mapped to a vector (the specific details of how that works will be explained in a future blog post). These vectors’ angles’ closeness tries to portray semantic relations, but not exactly in the way you might think.\nFor example, synonyms and antonyms (words that mean similar things and words that mean the opposite, respectively) would not be pointing in completely opposite directions, but rather all approximately in a similar direction.\nThis is because, if you think it, “hot” and “cold” are still about temperatures, so they should point to a similar place. Something that has nothing to do with temperatures whatsoever, such as “skibidi” (although to be fair, “skibidi” has nothing to do with anything useful whatsoever), should point in the opposite direction. How exactly do the angles portray semantic closeness? The cosine of the angle does.\nIf the directions are close, then the cosine will be almost \\(1\\), but if the directions are near-opposite, then the directions will be \\(-1\\), so the higher number reflects that the meanings are closer.\nThe magnitudes of the vectors refer to how frequent or useful the words are, as well."

Instead, they make the voiced palatal approximant, voiceless velar fricative, unrounded open back vowel, voiced alveolar trill, voiceless uvular stop, voiceless palatal stop, and the glottal stop (glottal stop doesn’t have a voiced version, because it’s just the break between “uh” and “oh” in “uh-oh”)."

There’s even Greek letters, which somehow we can never evade, regardless of the subject. /ɸ/, /θ/, /ʎ/, /ɤ/, and /ʊ/ are not phi, theta, lambda, gamma, and upside-down omega, but instead voiceless bilabial fricative, voiceless alveolar fricative, voiced palatal lateral approximant, back close-mid unrounded vowel, and then this random vowel that doesn’t know where it belongs. Phew. That torture is over. Or is it?"

Instead, I’ll just say that the diacritics can alter a sound to fit any of the variations for consonants and vowels I talked about earlier, such as nasality, gemination, voiceless, tone, and more."
