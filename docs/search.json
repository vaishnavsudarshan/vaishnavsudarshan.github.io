    "text": "Right now, you might be wondering: “Sir, what is this? I learned this in 4th grade! Isn’t linear algebra just graphing lines on the coordinate plane and solving equations?” NO! Linear algebra has almost nothing to do with that, at least in the beginning. Now, let’s get into actual linear algebra.\n\n\nVectors are basically the foundation of linear algebra. No, a vector is not named after the Despicable Me villain; it’s the other way around. A vector is, in short, an arrow in space, that you can think of as moving a point at its tail to its tip. In physics, you learn that a vector is a quantity with magnitude and direction. This means that the length of the vector matters, and so does the direction it points in. You can also represent a vector most abstractly, as a list of numbers. This is how computers view vectors. Each number tells the coordinate of each dimension of the arrow. For example, the vector \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nwould represent a vector whose components are 1 unit in the \\(x\\) direction, and 2 units in the \\(y\\) direction: \nIn other words, it’s about \\(2.236\\) units long and points about \\(63.435\\) degrees measured counterclockwise from the x axis. Vectors can be multiplied by a number, also known as a scalar. This will scale, or stretch/shrink, the magnitude of the vector by the number. If the number is negative, the vector will be in the opposite direction. You can think of adding vectors \\(A\\) and \\(B\\) as first moving along \\(A\\), then from that ending point moving along \\(B\\). The original starting point to the new ending point will be the resultant vector. Similarly, you can compute \\(A - B\\) by scaling \\(B\\) by \\(-1\\). In terms of the components, you can just add each corresponding component, as this will be the net movement. For example, \\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n1 \\\\\n2 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n+\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n3 \\\\\n4 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]\nwill be\n\\[\n\\begin{pmatrix}\n4 \\\\\n6 \\\\\n\\end{pmatrix}\n\\]"

    "title": "Writing systems",
    "section": "Phonetic Orthographies",
    "text": "Phonetic Orthographies\nIn phonetic writing systems, symbols are written based on sound. For example, in the Latin alphabet, the word “cat” is written with a “c” for the “c” sound, “a” for the “a” sound, and “t” for the “t” sound. Of course, it’s not always one-to-one, or even consistent, in English itself, but the main point still stands - it’s based on sound. In our language, you wouldn’t draw an image of a cat to represent a cat, you’d just write “cat” based on the sounds of the word. Here are the types of phonetic writing systems:\n\nAlphabets\nAlphabets work by having symbols for vowels and consonants, and they’re just written without really being treated as separate phonemes. These are arguably the simplest. Apart from the Latin alphabet, some others are Cyrillic, Greek, IPA, Georgian, Armenian, etc. Korean’s writing system, Hangeul, is kind of like an alphabet because it writes out its vowels and consonants, but it arranges each syllable into its own block. The word alphabet comes from the first to letters of Greek, alpha and beta.\n\n\nAbjads\nMost alphabets evolved from abjads. Abjads are like alphabets, except usually, most of the vowels aren’t written, and instead inferred from context. Only long vowels are written. Sometimes, for clarity, the short vowels may be written in with diacritics. For example, in the Quran, even though the Arabic script is an abjad, all the vowels were written so that there aren’t any misinterpretations. The word “abjad” comes from the first four letters of the Arabic script, “a”, “b”, “j”, and “d”, which is cognate with Greek’s “alpha”, “beta”, “gamma”, “delta”. The most prominent example of abjads are the orthographies of Semitic languages, which it works well for due to their triconsonantal root system, where consonants carry the meaning and vowels just modify the word. Hwvr, f y d ths n nglsh, t wll b prtt mssd p nd nt t ll ntllgbl.\n\n\nSyllabaries\nIn syllabaries, each symbol is a syllable, usually a pair of consonant and vowel. These work well for languages that don’t have crazy consonant clusters, like Japanese and Cherokee. However, if a language has a lot of possible syllables due to its large phonology, then there would be way too many symbols.\n\n\nAbugidas\nAbugidas, in my opinion, are by far the coolest type of phonetic orthography. How it works is that if you write a consonant on its own, it comes with a vowel after it. For example, the /k/ sound in Devanagari, क, is actually pronounced /kə/ because without altering the consonant, it comes with an /ə/ sound. To make it a different vowel, you add a diacritic. So, /ke/ would be के. And, to make it just /k/ with no vowel, you make it क्. The most popular abugidas are from India, including Devanagiri, Tamil, Bengali, etc. However, the word “abugida” comes from the Ge’ez script from Ethiopia, where the first four letters are “a”, “bu”, “gi”, and “da” (and this arrangement is cognate with Greek’s “alpha”, “beta”, “gamma”, “delta”, just like with the word “Abjad”)."

    "title": "Writing systems",
    "section": "Semantic Orthographies",
    "text": "Semantic Orthographies\nInstead of writing symbols based on sound, some languages have orthographies where symbols are based on meaning.\n\nLogographies\nThe most common type of semantic writing system is a logography, and the most famous type of logography is Hanzi from Sinitic languages, which is also what Japanese’s Kanji is based on. For example, look at the symbol for “yi” in Mandarin or “ichi” in Japanese, which means “one”: “一” Now, for “er” in Mandarin or “ni” in Japanese, which means “two”: “二” So, sometimes, the symbol looks like what it means. However, sometimes, it can be more complicated than that. In Mandarin, each symbol is generally one syllable as well, and sometimes symbols are made based on their relation with other semantic meanings, so you can build up symbols from smaller symbols. For example, the symbol for “forest” is 森, and the symbol for “tree” is 木. Also, symbols whose words sound similar can also be used for clarification. Egyptian hieroglyphs were part logography. Some symbols worked just like Chinese, and others evolved into more of a syllabary or abjad.\n\n\nPictographies\nPictographies are kind of like logographies, except that it’s much more literal. Unlike Hanzi, where a lot of characters are derived from abstract connections, pictographies are literal depictions. This is likely where writing started first. An example is the Mayan script, where a lot of it was pictographic, but other symbols evolved into being logographic or syllabic. Also, even emojis are largely pictographic. However, pictographs, like logographs, still just represent words.\n\n\nIdeographies\nIdeographies are another type of semantic orthography, where an idea or a concept is directly written, without being tied to a specific sound. For example, some street signs symbols that don’t have words but rather symbols, some of the more ancient Hanzi initially, or even some of the more abstract emojis as well are ideographies."

    "title": "Writing systems",
    "section": "Evolution of writing",
    "text": "Evolution of writing\nMany writing systems evolved from Egyptian hieroglyphs, to become primarily alphabets, abjads, or even abugidas. This is primarily in Europe, the Middle East, and North Africa, where Egypt indirectly influenced. For example, the European alphabets evolved from Ancient Greek’s alphabet (Latin through the Etruscan alphabet, which in turn came from the Ancient Greek alphabet), which evolved from Phoenecian’s abjad, which evolved from Egyptian hieroglyphs. Also, the Semitic abjads evolved from Phoenician’s abjad too. The Semitic languages are written from right to left, because it chose a direction to write from Phoenecian, which alternated. Ancient Greek also initially alternated directions line by line, but then chose to stick with only left to right, which all the European languages are written with now.\nIn India, as well as some parts of Southeast Asia, including Myanmar, Laos, and Thailand, the orthography (all abugidas) of those languages evolved from the Brahmi script, which was an abugida. It’s not certain where the Brahmi script is from, though it’s suggested to come from Egyptian hieroglyphs too, but it could also be an artificially created script that evolved naturally.\n\n\n\nAn example of Brahmi script found on The Iron Pillar in Qutub Minar, New Delhi, source\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\n\nFun factoid\n\n\n\nThe Brahmi script was initially all straight lines and sharp angles. In South India, Southeast Asia, and Sri Lanka, the letters look more curvy, because they were written on leaves, so sharp turns and straight lines would tear the leaves. However, in North India, the letters can be more angular and sharp, but still also some curves, because they were written on both leaves and stone.\n\n\nIn China and Japan, the characters are derived from the Ancient Chinese logographic characters. In Japan, there are three writing systems. Two are syllabaries derived from Chinese, and the other is the normal Chinese logography.\nIn both Koreas, Hangeul is used. Hangeul is an artificially created script that was made to address the high percentage of illiteracy, due to the fact that Chinese characters were way to hard for the common people to learn. However, Hangeul was designed to be very simple.\nThe Cherokee syllabary was made after one Native American looked at the European colonizers’ writing and tried to mimic the symbols to make a writing system for Cherokee. He’d seen both the Latin and Cyrillic scripts. However, the symbols in Cherokee that look similar to the European writing make completely different sounds, as he only knew the shape of the symbols, not what sound they made."

    "text": "Pronunciation and Alphabet\nLimit is written in Roman characters (for now, that is; we will introduce the real writing system later), but there are some rules to how the script works.\nConsonants are mostly lowercase, with the only exception being the letter “L”, which is always capitalized. Each consonant is a short sound. Short vowel sounds are lowercase, while long vowel sounds are uppercase. The language is very phonetic; the pronunciation is exactly what is written. There are no silent letters.\nExamples for how to write and pronounce vowels:\n1. A short “O” like in the word “dog” would be lowercase.\n2. A long “A” like in the word “cake” would be uppercase.\n\n\n\n\n\n\nNote\n\n\n\nA quick note: The letter “U” (capital, which means long) does not contain a “y” sound in its pronunciation. It sounds like the o’s in the word “food” rather than the u in the word “university”.\nThere are some vowel and consonant sounds, of course, that cannot be produced with just the Roman alphabet. Therefore, the Limit alphabet contains some extra characters as well.\n\n\n\nExtra vowel sounds\n\n“%” sounds like “oo” in the word “book”.\n\n“@” sounds like “ow” like in the word “now”.\n\n“α” sounds like “ah” like in the word “drama”\n\n“&” sounds like “oi” like in the word “boy”.\n\n“*” sounds like “er” like in the word “singer”.\n\n“^” sounds like “on” like in the word “bon” in French (used for foreign loanwords).\n\n\n\nExtra consonant sounds\n\n“#” sounds like “zh”, like in the s in “measure”.\n\n“~” sounds like “th”, like in the word “think”.\n\n“β” sounds like the n in “song”.\n\n“!” sounds like “sh”, like in the word “shook”.\n\n\n\nOther adjustments to the alphabet\n\nTo make the “ar” or “or” sound, take “α” or “O” and add “*”.\n\nThe letter “c” is removed as its sound can be made from either “k” or “s”.\n\nThe letter “g” only can sound like the g in “gray”, and NOT sound like a j, like in “giraffe”.\n\nThe letter “j” is removed as any sound with a “j” can be made from “d#”.\n\nThe letter “q” is removed as any “qu” sound can be made with “kw” instead. “u”, however, is still perfectly safe as it is important for various vowel sounds.\n\nThe letter “x” is removed as any sound with an “x” can be made from either “ks” or “z”.\n\nSlashes indicate that some specific words are grouped together.\n\nOne last thing: Limit is pronounced in either an Indian or an American accent, except with the new pronunciation rules now given."

    "text": "Numbers\nBase 10 is used, like normal.\nOne shorthand is implemented; whenever there is a 1 followed by a 0, it is written as θ.\nNumbers are written as normal Arabic numerals, but obviously they are said differently.\n0: “fA”\n1: “hα”\n2: “rO”\n3: “d#U”\n4: “yA”\n5: “.a”\n6: “brU”\n7: “,O”\n8: “we”\n9: “gI”\nTo get more numbers, you do the following:\nWrite each digit in the bigger number as the sum of each digit times a power of 10. For example, 243 would be 2*102+4*101+3*10^0.\nYou may know that “time ten to the power of” can also be written as “E”. In Limit, the symbol for this is “$”, pronounced “sigmα”. Fun fact: this word also means “and”.\nYou would write the each place value from highest exponent to lowest.\nInstead of saying plus, you would just combine each term with a slash.\nUnits digits do not need to be written as a$0, just a.\nBack to the example of 243, in Limit you would say this as:\n2$2/4\\(1/3, and pronounce this as rO\\)rO/yA$hα/jU, and remember that $ is pronounced as sigmα.\nFor negative numbers, add the suffix “yO”.\nFor ordinal numbers, add the suffix “hO”, after the “yO” if it is there.\nFor fractions, just use the postposition for “in”, which is the suffix “krA” or “OkrA”. There will be a space after that.\nYou can also just list each digit, but then you must indicate the decimal point when applicable, which is pronounced as “%nd” and is written as “*”.\nExample:\nYou would say “31.4th” as “jU\\(hα/hα/yA\\)hαyOhO”."

    "section": "Prepositions",
    "text": "Prepositions\nFirst, be sure to note that Limit uses a suffix for prepositions (so they are actually postpositions) like “in”, “at”, “during”, “of”, etc; this means anything that gives the position or time, not something that is being headed towards. This suffix is “gE”, or “OgE”, depending on if the word ends in a vowel or consonant.\nThere is also a suffix for something you are heading to. This includes words such as “before”, “to”, or “for”. The suffix is “bU”, or “ObU”, depending on if the word ends in a vowel or consonant.\nFinally, for something you are coming from, such as “from”, “after”, or “past”, the suffix will be either “zA” or “OzA”."
