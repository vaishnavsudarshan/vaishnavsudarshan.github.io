# Long ago

Long before "Skibidi Toilet" or "Tung Tung Tung Sahur" or "siiiiix sevennnnn" or the "Great Meme Reset" or whatever else kids these days talk about, there was an obscure, unimportant, little-talked-about empire, which I doubt most people even heard of, called the Roman Empire. 

The Roman Empire spoke Latin. If you don't know what that is, you're not missing out on much - basically no one speaks it anyway, except for a handful of poor middle schoolers whose school forces them to "learn" it (memorize pointless declension charts). Latin is a language from the Italic branch of the Indo-European family. The Roman Empire was based, as it will likely come as a shock, in Rome, which is now in Italy. 

Now, scroll a little bit away from Italy on Google Maps, and you'll find France, which is what we're supposedly interested in. However, the language was actually closer to modern-day Scottish Gaelic than modern-day French. The people there spoke another Indo-European language, this time on the Celtic branch, called Gaulish.
