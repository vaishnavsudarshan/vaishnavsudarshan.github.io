# Linear Operators

A linear operator $L$ is just anything that satisfies $L(ax+by)=aL(x)+bL(y)$, for constants $a$ and $b$, and where addition and multiplication are defined. In other words, it is additive, and you can pull out constants from the inside. 

Matrices are where you probably saw this. If you transform a vector $x$ by multiplying it with $A$, do the same for a vector $y$, and add the two new vectors, it's the same as just adding them first and then transforming them. Also, if you scale $x$ and $y$ by some constants, it doesn't matter if you did it before or after the transformation.

# Derivatives As Linear Operators

Do you remember the sum and product rules of single-variable derivatives? 

$\frac{d}{dx} (af(x)) = a \frac{d}{dx} f(x)$
$\frac{d}{dx} (f(x) + g(x)) = \frac{d}{dx} f(x) + \frac{d}{dx} g(x)$

Wait, what??? Differentiation is also a linear operator on functions??? Now you realize how cool generalizing stuff is.

Hold on. Is $y=mx+b$ linear on $x$, for $b \neq 0$? The answer, surprisingly, is no. $m(x_1+x_2)+b \neq (mx_1+b)+(mx_2+b)$. Linear, in this the context of this blog post, doesn't necessarily mean the function is a line, but rather that the function behaves like a linear operator, which are typically different things. 

Derivatives, however, aren't just limited to acting on single-variables to be linear operators. Here are some other types of derivatives.

# Making Derivatives More Abstract

For single variable functions, we have a scalar in and a scalar out (one input, one output). You could technically think of it as 1D vectors, as we'll do soon, but it's basically the same thing.

## Multivariable Functions

For multivariable functions, we have many inputs in and one output out, where each input or output is a number. However, one interpretation of a vector is a list of numbers, so one could think of it as a vector in and a scalar out. What this means is that, for a 2D input space, $f(\vec{x}) = f(x, y)$. 
For any point, or vector, on the 2D $xy$ plane, there is a $z$ coordinate corresponding to that, to form some sort of surface. 

Again, what we basically just mean in this case is that a vector has two or more dimensions, and a scalar has just one. If we think of a list of numbers as a vector, then we can do vector operations on it, but if we think of a single number as a vector, doing vector operations on it wouldn't make a difference.

## Vector-Valued Functions

What about a vector output for a scalar input? This could be represented as a parametric equation, and the derivative would also be a vector. An example of this is in physics, with velocity and acceleration, both as a function of time. See the diagram for these in circular motion.

To demonstrate where more abstract derivatives can be used in this case, we can use parametric equations. Let the counterclockwise angle above the horizontal of the particle moving in a circle be $\theta$, and the radius be $r$. From components, the direction of the position of the particle from the center is $[cos(\theta), sin(\theta)]$. Then, from geometry, since motion is perpendicular to the radius, the horizontal component of velocity (assuming constant speed $v$) is $-v sin(\theta)$, and the vertical component is $v cos(\theta)$. Given that $\omega = d\theta/dt$ and $v=\omega r$, try to prove for yourself that the centripetal acceleration must have magnitude $\frac{v^2}{r}$ and point towards the center! The full solution is in my [_blog post about circular motion_](../Circular%20Motion/).

## Vector Fields

At this point, we are exiting the more basic types of functions, and finally, matrices come into use here.
