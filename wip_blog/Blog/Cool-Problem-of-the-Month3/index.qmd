# Yapping

Ahh, 2025 is over! That was a once in a lifetime year! For once, it was a perfect square, and the next one will come in 2116. Yet even that is not very cool number, because who cares about the square of 46? 45 is a much nicer number compared to that. 45 is a triangular number (sum of the first nine positive integers in this case), so 2025 is the square of this triangular number, which you may recall also means it's the sum of the first nine cubes.

$\sum_{i=1}^{n} i^3 = \frac{n^2 (n-1)^2}{4} = [\frac{n(n-1)}{2}]^2 = (\sum_{i=1}^{n} i)^2$. 

Also, since 2025 is the square of 45, it's the sum of the first 45 odd numbers
